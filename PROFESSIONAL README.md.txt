# Student Performance Prediction

This project demonstrates a basic supervised machine learning pipeline using Python.
The goal is to predict student performance based on study hours using Linear Regression.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Project Workflow
1. Created and loaded dataset
2. Performed data visualization
3. Split data into training and testing sets
4. Trained a Linear Regression model
5. Evaluated the model using RMSE
6. Made predictions on new data

## Model Used
- Linear Regression

## Evaluation Metric
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

## Result
The model successfully predicts student scores based on study hours and demonstrates
the complete machine learning workflow from data preprocessing to evaluation.

## Future Improvements
- Use real-world datasets
- Add more features (attendance, previous scores)
- Extend towards decision-making applications
